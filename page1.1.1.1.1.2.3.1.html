            <p class="ptext">Harambe decides to brave the night at the Burnet Woods
            and sleep there. Harambe wakes up to zoo officials with guns, Harambe
            thinks he is dead at this point but they just tranquilize him. Harambe
            wakes up in the horrid place he was in earlier called the zoo prison.
            Harambe looks around and doesn't see his friend that was in there,
            perhaps the gorilla had escaped after he ditched him. Harambe will
            never know because Harambe is kept in there for the remainder of his
            life until he rots.
