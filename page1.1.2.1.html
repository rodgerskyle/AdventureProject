            <p class="ptext">Harambe shows off how cool his roar was to the female
            gorillas by demonstrating it. The female gorillas all oooh and ahh
            over awesome Harambe. Harambe's visit with the girls is cut short
            when he is knocked over the head with a blunt object. Harambe wakes
            up in a circle around other gorillas and George is on the other side.
            Harambe remembers what he did earlier with the banana. George looks
            like he is ready for a fight against this Harambe.</p>
