            <p class="ptext">Harambe attempts to grab his friend that has helped
            him scheme the idea of escaping. Harambe grabs onto his friend and the
            friend throws Harambe into the guard. His friend, don't know if he can
            call him that anymore, but the friend escapes out of there. Harambe is
            locked up and from that moment on the guards don't go back into the cell.
            Harambe spends the rest of his life in there slowly rotting and soon
            after he dies. He never knew what happened to his friend but at least
            he did the right thing by trying to save his supposed friend.</p>
