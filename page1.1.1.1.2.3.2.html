            <p class="ptext">Harambe tries to be a pacifist about his friend walking
            into the room. He tries to run right by the gorilla but the gorila tackles
            Harambe and throws him around very viciously. Harambe tries his best
            to get away from him but he can't loosen the grip he has. The gorilla
            really messes Harambe up and just leaves him there when he is done.
            His supposed friend, leaves him there to die and Harambe does indeed
            after a couple of days with broken ribs and a couple of major injuries.
