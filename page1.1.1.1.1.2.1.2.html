            <p class="ptext">Harambe runs away from whatever he had seen in the
            corner of his eye. Harambe manages to get to a peaceful spot in the
            woods. He is very alone until he notices a squirrel who speaks gorilla
            because he used to go to the same zoo Harambe was from. The squirrel
            and Harambe become very good friends and benefit each other. The squirrel
            could grab food for Harambe that he couldn't get to and Harambe was
            the squirrel's protector from other creatures. Harambe lives out his
            life in the Mount Ary Forest with his new found friend that was a
            squirrel.
